# Theoretical and Experimental Studies of Diffraction on Optical Disks

## Abstract

Incident light on an optical disk produces a distinct bright line on its surface, with the line's characteristics influenced by the relative orientations of the light source, the optical disk, and the observer. While this phenomenon is commonly discussed in many optics courses, prior research presents incorrect underlying principles. This study employs the Fraunhofer diffraction framework to investigate the underlying physics of the observed single line and to precisely quantify its position, color, and geometry. The developed theoretical model demonstrates excellent agreement with experimental data from both spectrometry and color comparisons between digitally reproduced simulations and directly observed colors. Furthermore, an additional class of line resulting from an alternative mechanism, side incidence, is introduced. The additional line's physical principles are also validated and show great consistency with directly observed colors.

## How to Navigate this Repository

This repository is a supplement to my research paper, which can also be found here in pdf format. This repository stores the gifs of 1) simulations 2) direct photographs of written 3) direct photographs of unwritten CDs and DVDs in Cases 1 through 3 (refer to the paper for the definition of these cases). The folders that store these gifs are named accordingly. Because it is hard to confirm the validity of the simulation by going back and forth between the simulated gif and the experiment animation gif, videos that directly compare the simulations to the photographs side-by-side had been uploaded to the 'comparison' folder.
