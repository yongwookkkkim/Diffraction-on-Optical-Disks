## Abstract

A bright line is visible on the surface of an optical disk when light is incident on it. The line's geometry, position, and color depend on the orientation between the light source, optical disk, and the observer. The framework of Fraunhofer diffraction has been applied to quantify this interesting diffraction phenomenon and to predict these characteristics of the 'colored line.' Additionally, color theory was employed to reproduce the predicted color of the line digitally. Comparison with results from spectrometry and direct color comparison showed excellent agreement. Lastly, extensive theoretical analysis has been conducted on additional interesting lines visible through mechanisms other than simple diffraction - namely, due to incidence through the side of a disk and the randomness of data.
