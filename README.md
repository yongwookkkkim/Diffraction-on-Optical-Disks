# Theoretical and Experimental Studies of Diffraction on Optical Disks

Yong-Wook Kim

## Abstract

A bright line is visible on the surface of an optical disk when light is incident on it. The line's geometry, position, and color depend on the orientation between the light source, optical disk, and the observer. The framework of Fraunhofer diffraction has been applied to quantify this interesting diffraction phenomenon and to predict these characteristics of the 'colored line.' Additionally, color theory was employed to reproduce the predicted color of the line digitally. Comparison with results from spectrometry and direct color comparison showed excellent agreement. Lastly, extensive theoretical analysis has been conducted on additional interesting lines visible through mechanisms other than simple diffraction - namely, due to incidence through the side of a disk and the randomness of data.

## How to Navigate this Repository

This repository is a supplement to my research paper, which can also be found here in pdf format. The 'videos' folder stores the gifs of 1) simulations 2) direct photographs of written 3) direct photographs of unwritten CDs and DVDs in Cases 1 through 3 (refer to the paper for the definition of these cases). The subfolders that store these gifs are named accordingly. Because it is hard to confirm the validity of the simulation by going back and forth between the simulated gif and the experiment animation gif, videos that directly compare the simulations to the direct photographs side-by-side had been uploaded to the 'comparison' subfolder.

You can also look at the python codes that I ran to simulate the colored lines in the 'codes' folder (though they're quite messy...)!
