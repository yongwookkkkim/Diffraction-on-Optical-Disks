## Abstract

A bright line is visible on the surface of an optical disk when light is incident on it. The geometry, position, and color of the line are dependent on the orientation between the light source, optical disk, and the observer. The framework of Fraunhofer diffraction had been applied to quantify this interesting diffraction phenomenon, and to predict these characteristics of the 'colored line'. Additionally, color theory was employed to digitally reproduce the predicted color of the line. Comparison with results from spectrometry and direct color comparison showed great agreement. Lastly, a brief analysis on additional interesting lines that are visible through mechanisms other than simple diffraction are introduced.
